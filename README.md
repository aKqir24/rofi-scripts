# rofi-scripts

The scripts I use in almost everything I want to access in the a my desktop. Disclaimer, some of the scripts are not entirely mine, namely the `bluetooth`, and `wifi`.

# How To Use
__DEPENDENCIES__

**Running with my dotfiles**
```bash
    bash show.sh \

```

**Running it manually**
```bash 
    # You might need to configure the theme
    sh [wifi.sh, bluetooth.sh]
